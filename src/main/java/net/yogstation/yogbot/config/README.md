# Configuration Classes
The classes in this package all represent some subset of the configuration for this bot. 

## Configuring the configs
The default values in these classes should be either the value to be used on the live version of yogbot, 
or if that is not possible, such as keys, a reasonable default for use in local testing.

If you wish to configure the bot for your local testing, the easiest way would be to make an 
application.properties file in a config directory in the root of the project, that can be used to override these values.
For example, setting the bot token would have the key/value pair `yogbot.discord.botToken=<token>`

You can also use any of the methods outlined in the [spring documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config).
